# Dummy Provider Specification

## Overview

The dummy provider is a
[Fediverse Auxiliary Service Provider](../general/provider_instance_interaction_v0.1.md)
that only has a single capability, that includes one API endpoint and
the ability to call one API endpoint in registered instances.

It is meant to aid in developing provider integrations into existing
fediverse software.
